title ML Copilot-Driven HNSCC Prognostic Workflow (Detailed)

start

:0. Setup & Configuration;
note right
  - Define file paths (TCGA/CPTAC)
  - K_RANGE = 2 to 10
  - CLUSTERING_METHODS = [KMeans, Agglomerative, GMM]
  - FEATURE_SIZES = [2, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, ...]
  - RUNS = 100
  - P-value thresholds (TCGA & CPTAC)
end note

:1. Load & Align Data;
note right
  - Read TCGA expr & surv
  - Subset to common PatientIDs
  - Save aligned CSVs
end note

partition "2. Initial Unsupervised Clustering & Evaluation" {
  :For each method in [KMeans, Agglomerative, GMM];
  while (k = 2 to 10)
    :Cluster TCGA (all genes) with method, k;
    :Compute KM curves & pairwise log-rank;
    :Capture min p-value for this (method, k);
  end while
  :Select best (method*, k*) with lowest p-value;
  note right
    Save best cluster labels & model
  end note
}

:3. Define Binary Labels;
note right
  - Take the two largest clusters from step 2
  - Map to labels {0, 1}
  - Subset expression & survival for these samples
end note

partition "4. Binary Classification (TCGA-only Train/Test)" {
  :For each fsize in FEATURE_SIZES;
  while (run = 1 to RUNS)
    :Train/Test split TCGA subset (30% test);
    :SelectKBest(fsize) on train;
    :Train classifiers [LR, RF, SVM, KNN, GBM];
    :Evaluate Acc, Prec, Rec, F1, AUC & ROC;
    :Save model, selector & features;
  end while
}

:5. Aggregate Performance;
note right
  - Compute mean Â± std AUC per (model, fsize)
  - Save aggregated CSV
end note

partition "6. Cross-Cohort Validation & Model Selection" {
  :For each fsize in FEATURE_SIZES;
  :Pick model* with highest mean AUC;
  :Load model* & its features;
  :Predict full TCGA -> log-rank (p_TCGA);
  :Predict CPTAC -> log-rank (p_CPTAC);
  :Record (model*, fsize, p_TCGA, p_CPTAC);
  :Apply strict -> relaxed -> fallback criteria;
  :Select overall best model & run;
}

:7. Generate Final KM Plots;
note right
  - Plot KM for full TCGA with best model
  - Plot KM for CPTAC with same features
end note

:8. Re-Clustering on TCGA with Selected Features;
note right
  - Cluster TCGA (method*, k*) using only best features
  - Evaluate survival separation & compare p-values
end note
